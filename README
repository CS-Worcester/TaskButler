* TASK BUTLER - A task organization app for Android                           *
*******************************************************************************

Task Butler is a personal assistant app that helps keep your life organized. 
Use Task Butler to keep track of all of your shopping, errands, bills, to-do 
lists, and more. You can group your tasks into categories to create sub-lists 
of similar tasks. You can assign due dates to tasks, and Task Butler will 
remind you when it's time to complete them. For an especially time-sensitive 
task, use the procrastination alarm and Task Butler will make sure you finish 
it!

Features
* Create tasks as simply or as detailed as you want
* Create color-coded categories to group tasks into separate lists
* Let Task Butler automatically sort your task list, or define your own custom 
  sorting parameters
* Assign due dates, due date repetition, and procrastination alarms to tasks
* Lightweight and low on system resources

Task Butler is being developed as part of CS 499 Summer 2012 at Worcester State
University.
